**Hi, I am Tian-Qi Huang(黄天奇)**

I am the PhD student at [Department of Astronomy](http://astro.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). I am goint to attend the PhD thesis defense in 2022. Good luck to my job application this year.

I'm currently working on the high energy neutrinos from star-forming galaxies/star-burst galaxies and also interseted in the gamma-ray sources detecter above 100 TeV, which give us some clues about the gamma-ray productions and neutrino productions in star-forming regions.
